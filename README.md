# 42Piscine

This repository contains all the projects I did during my participation in the C Piscine at the Malaga campus from 17 October to 11 November 2022.

## About 42

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology based on the following [principles](https://42.fr/en/the-program/innovative-learning/):
- No courses. No teachers. No classes
- A project method
- Failing is progressing
- Peer-to-peer learning
- Peer-to-peer evaluation
- Group work is not cheating

The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process. The so-called "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp, is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student).

## Skills developed at C Piscine
### Hard-skills
- **C Language**

	The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

- **Shell**

	The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

- **Git**

	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.

### Soft-skills

- **Self-learning and proactiveness**
	
  At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
	are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
	your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

- **Teamwork**
	
  On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
	chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
	The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
	common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

- **Time management and resiliency**
	
  The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
	they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not
	"drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
