# 42Piscine

## About 42

The highlight of the selection at 42 is the Piscine. (https://42.fr/en/admissions/42-piscine/)
You don’t have to know how to code to apply to the Piscine at 42. Whatever your starting level is, the idea is to test the candidates’ involvement capacity during the Piscine at 42. Rather than offering a straight computer initiation, the Piscine at 42 lets you start the curriculum with intensive training in C, the first language you have to use during the training course. For one month, the Piscine at 42 lets you tackle the teaching methods of the school: peer-to-peer learning, group work, peer-evaluation and project pedagogy.

THE 42 METHOD
With 42, programming is not taught in a lecture hall: the lessons are practical and based on the principles of sharing, collaboration and mutual aid.

LEARNING TOGETHER: PEER-TO-PEER
You have to excel in order to progress. However, once you’ve reached a dead end, the first reflex is to ask advice from the people around you. Projects carried out alone or in a group must first be discussed then evaluated by other peers who have not necessarily progressed at the same pace. In these moments of exchange, you have to justify your choices, give arguments on “why” you decided to solve the project like you did. These moments help consolidate personal learning and share knowledge with the community. Collective intelligence, which allows good practices to emerge and groups to advance, plays a major role at 42.

LEARNING THROUGH PRACTICE
Learning at 42 involves seeking concrete solutions to the problems you face – rather than having to memorize lessons without any practical applications. From your very first steps at 42 – namely, the Piscine – you are asked to think for yourself in front of a computer. Of course, no one expects you to be able to do  everything from the start: Failing and making mistakes are not penalized. In fact, failures and mistakes are a better way to learn than lectures. At 42, making errors and messing up are simply an invitation to try again, just like in a video game.

LEARNING WHILE HAVING FUN
At 42, everyone’s progress is personalized. It is based on a system of experience points and levels, just like in a video game. This is what we call “gamification”. There are many ways to reach 21, the top level, and go even higher. The working atmosphere maintained by other members of the community stimulates collective energy. And if you want to take a break, there are numerous events organized throughout the year at 42.
