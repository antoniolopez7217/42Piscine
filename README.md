# 42Piscine

This repository contains all the projects I completed during my participation in the C Piscine at the Malaga campus from 17 October to 11 November 2022.

## About 42

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology based on the following [principles](https://42.fr/en/the-program/innovative-learning/):
- No courses. No teachers. No classes
- A project method
- Failing is progressing
- Peer-to-peer learning
- Peer-to-peer evaluation
- Group work is not cheating

The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process. The so-called "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp, is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student). 

During the Piscine, I learned **C Language** (It is the main program used for both projects and exams), **Shell** (The first two days are dedicated to learning the necessary commands to be able to navigate through the MAC terminal) and **Git** (All projects are submitted via a remote git repository).

## Curriculum

Below are all the projects/exams I did during the Piscine stage in chronological order. Also, I have included the level that I got in the 42 intranet after submitting each project.
